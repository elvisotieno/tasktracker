In the project directory, you can:

cd to BakendAPI/tasktracker and run
python manage.py runserver to start the development server at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

To run the app in the development mode.
cd into Frontend/tasks-ui and run
npm start to
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console, the time values and the tasks being posted to the database periodically.


To build the app for production to the build folder, you can merge the frontend and backend into one file by dragging the tasks-ui file into tasktracker file.
Then run: npm run build
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

I can provide more infomation about deployment section using GitHub action to control CI/CD workflow in conjunction with docker and AWS.
